== Injector

`Injector` is an entry point for all DI-managed objects.
Injector allows getting configured services directly or via a lazy provider.
You can get services by their binding keys.

Also, the `Injector` API contains some useful methods for container retrospection.

* `injector.hasProvider()` method allows checking presence of the binding.
* `injector.getKeysByType()` method returns collection of key bound to given type, regardless of additional qualifiers.
