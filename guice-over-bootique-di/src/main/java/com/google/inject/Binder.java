/**
 * Collects configuration information (primarily <i>bindings</i>) which will be used to create an
 * {@link Injector}. Guice provides this object to your application's {@link Module} implementors so
 * they may each contribute their own bindings and other registrations.
 *
 * <h3>The Guice Binding EDSL</h3>
 * <p>
 * Guice uses an <i>embedded domain-specific language</i>, or EDSL, to help you create bindings
 * simply and readably. This approach is great for overall usability, but it does come with a small
 * cost: <b>it is difficult to learn how to use the Binding EDSL by reading method-level
 * javadocs</b>. Instead, you should consult the series of examples below. To save space, these
 * examples omit the opening {@code binder}.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     bind(ServiceImpl.class);</pre>
 * <p>
 * This statement does essentially nothing; it "binds the {@code ServiceImpl} class to itself" and
 * does not change Guice's default behavior. You may still want to use this if you prefer your
 * {@link Module} class to serve as an explicit <i>manifest</i> for the services it provides. Also,
 * in rare cases, Guice may be unable to validate a binding at injector creation time unless it is
 * given explicitly.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     bind(Service.class).to(ServiceImpl.class);</pre>
 * <p>
 * Specifies that a request for a {@code Service} instance with no binding annotations should be
 * treated as if it were a request for a {@code ServiceImpl} instance.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     bind(Service.class).toProvider(ServiceProvider.class);</pre>
 * <p>
 * In this example, {@code ServiceProvider} must extend or implement {@code Provider<Service>}. This
 * binding specifies that Guice should resolve an unannotated injection request for {@code Service}
 * by first resolving an instance of {@code ServiceProvider} in the regular way, then calling {@link
 * Provider#get get()} on the resulting Provider instance to obtain the {@code Service} instance.
 *
 * <p>The {@link Provider} you use here does not have to be a "factory"; that is, a provider which
 * always <i>creates</i> each instance it provides. However, this is generally a good practice to
 * follow. You can then use Guice's concept of {@link Scope scopes} to guide when creation should
 * happen -- "letting Guice work for you".
 *
 * <pre>
 *     bind(Service.class).annotatedWith(Red.class).to(ServiceImpl.class);</pre>
 * <p>
 * Like the previous example, but only applies to injection requests that use the binding annotation
 * {@code @Red}. If your module also includes bindings for particular <i>values</i> of the
 * {@code @Red} annotation (see below), then this binding will serve as a "catch-all" for any values
 * of {@code @Red} that have no exact match in the bindings.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     bind(ServiceImpl.class).in(Singleton.class);
 *     // or, alternatively
 *     bind(ServiceImpl.class).in(Scopes.SINGLETON);</pre>
 * <p>
 * Either of these statements places the {@code ServiceImpl} class into singleton scope. Guice will
 * create only one instance of {@code ServiceImpl} and will reuse it for all injection requests of
 * this type. Note that it is still possible to bind another instance of {@code ServiceImpl} if the
 * second binding is qualified by an annotation as in the previous example. Guice is not overly
 * concerned with <i>preventing</i> you from creating multiple instances of your "singletons", only
 * with <i>enabling</i> your application to share only one instance if that's all you tell Guice you
 * need.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> a scope specified in this way <i>overrides</i> any scope that was specified with
 * an annotation on the {@code ServiceImpl} class.
 *
 * <p>Besides {@link Singleton}, there are servlet-specific scopes
 * available in {@code com.google.inject.servlet.ServletScopes}, and your Modules can contribute
 * their own custom scopes for use here as well.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     bind(new TypeLiteral&lt;PaymentService&lt;CreditCard&gt;&gt;() {})
 *         .to(CreditCardPaymentService.class);</pre>
 * <p>
 * This admittedly odd construct is the way to bind a parameterized type. It tells Guice how to
 * honor an injection request for an element of type {@code PaymentService<CreditCard>}. The class
 * {@code CreditCardPaymentService} must implement the {@code PaymentService<CreditCard>} interface.
 * Guice cannot currently bind or inject a generic type, such as {@code Set<E>}; all type parameters
 * must be fully specified.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     bind(Service.class).toInstance(new ServiceImpl());
 *     // or, alternatively
 *     bind(Service.class).toInstance(SomeLegacyRegistry.getService());</pre>
 * <p>
 * In this example, your module itself, <i>not Guice</i>, takes responsibility for obtaining a
 * {@code ServiceImpl} instance, then asks Guice to always use this single instance to fulfill all
 * {@code Service} injection requests. When the {@link Injector} is created, it will automatically
 * perform field and method injection for this instance, but any injectable constructor on {@code
 * ServiceImpl} is simply ignored. Note that using this approach results in "eager loading" behavior
 * that you can't control.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     bindConstant().annotatedWith(ServerHost.class).to(args[0]);</pre>
 * <p>
 * Sets up a constant binding. Constant injections must always be annotated. When a constant
 * binding's value is a string, it is eligile for conversion to all primitive types, to {@link
 * Enum#valueOf(Class, String) all enums}, and to {@link Class#forName class literals}.
 *
 * <pre>
 *   {@literal @}Color("red") Color red; // A member variable (field)
 *    . . .
 *     red = MyModule.class.getDeclaredField("red").getAnnotation(Color.class);
 *     bind(Service.class).annotatedWith(red).to(RedService.class);</pre>
 * <p>
 * If your binding annotation has parameters you can apply different bindings to different specific
 * values of your annotation. Getting your hands on the right instance of the annotation is a bit of
 * a pain -- one approach, shown above, is to apply a prototype annotation to a field in your module
 * class, so that you can read this annotation instance and give it to Guice.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     bind(Service.class)
 *         .annotatedWith(Names.named("blue"))
 *         .to(BlueService.class);</pre>
 * <p>
 * Differentiating by names is a common enough use case that we provided a standard annotation,
 * {@link com.google.inject.name.Named @Named}. Because of Guice's library support, binding by name
 * is quite easier than in the arbitrary binding annotation case we just saw. However, remember that
 * these names will live in a single flat namespace with all the other names used in your
 * application.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     Constructor&lt;T&gt; loneCtor = getLoneCtorFromServiceImplViaReflection();
 *     bind(ServiceImpl.class)
 *         .toConstructor(loneCtor);</pre>
 * <p>
 * In this example, we directly tell Guice which constructor to use in a concrete class
 * implementation. It means that we do not need to place {@literal @}Inject on any of the
 * constructors and that Guice treats the provided constructor as though it were annotated so. It is
 * useful for cases where you cannot modify existing classes and is a bit simpler than using a
 * {@link Provider}.
 *
 * <p>The above list of examples is far from exhaustive. If you can think of how the concepts of one
 * example might coexist with the concepts from another, you can most likely weave the two together.
 * If the two concepts make no sense with each other, you most likely won't be able to do it. In a
 * few cases Guice will let something bogus slip by, and will then inform you of the problems at
 * runtime, as soon as you try to create your Injector.
